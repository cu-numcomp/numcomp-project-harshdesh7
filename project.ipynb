    "Given some matrix $V$ (it may be square or not), decompose the matrix down into $V = WH$. If the matrix $V$ has dimensions $m x n$, then $W$ will have dimesions $m x k$ and $H$ will have dimension $k x n$. $k$ is significantly smaller than $m$ or $n$ so that the factorization does not take too long to run as you are generally dealing with large datasets. What's interesting about this type of factorization is that it does not return an orthogonal basis like QR fractorizations do. $W$ is the basis retrieved and $H$ is a coefficient matrix\n",
